## Purpose of Moderation

Moderation exists to:

- Maintain a safe and respectful environment  
- Ensure meaningful participation  
- Uphold platform integrity and long-term vision  

Moderation is a tool to empower the community, not to restrict freedom of expression unnecessarily.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Transparency** – Users should understand why moderation actions are taken  
2. **Fairness** – Decisions are consistent and based on platform philosophy, not personal bias  
3. **Proportionality** – Responses match the severity and impact of the behavior  
4. **Education First** – Encourage learning and correction before punitive measures  

Moderation is proactive, not reactive.

## Moderator Responsibilities

Moderators are stewards, not enforcers.

- Monitor activity to prevent harassment, spam, and harmful behavior  
- Provide guidance and explanations for moderation actions  
- Promote positive engagement and clarity around rules  
- Escalate complex cases to product or leadership when necessary  

Moderators are expected to act consistently and uphold trust.

1. **Immediate Harm** – Prevent safety risks and harassment  
2. **System Integrity** – Ensure features are not exploited or misused  
3. **Community Values** – Uphold respectful, constructive participation  

Each decision is measured against platform philosophy and long-term ecosystem health.
