## Respectful Interaction

Clannect is a space for meaningful interaction.

- Treat others with respect, regardless of background or perspective
- Avoid harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks
- Focus on constructive feedback and positive engagement

Respect is the foundation of community trust.

## Meaningful Participation

Our platform encourages participation, not passive consumption.

- Contribute thoughtfully to posts and conversations
- Avoid spamming or flooding content feeds
- Ensure interactions align with the platform’s ethos of connection

Meaningful participation strengthens the ecosystem for everyone.

## Safe Spaces

Safety is a shared responsibility.

- Do not share private information of yourself or others
- Report suspicious, harmful, or abusive behavior
- Follow moderation guidance and respect platform policies

Users are expected to uphold safety standards for all participants.

## Integrity & Transparency

Interactions should be honest and transparent.

- Avoid misrepresentation or impersonation
- Do not manipulate engagement metrics or exploit mechanics
- Communicate intentions clearly in conversations and content

Trust is built on integrity.

## Collaboration Over Competition

While gamification encourages engagement, competition should never compromise respect.

- Celebrate achievements without undermining others
- Support allies and new members in learning the system
- Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing

Healthy competition strengthens the community, toxic rivalry weakens it.
